# magnum
A website to find a chess.com user's 'Magnus Number', using the Chess.com public API.
Live at https://mw9k.github.io/magnum/

- Unofficial hobby project; not associated with Chess.com.
- Attempts to find any Chess.com user's 'Magnus Number' - a chain of victories that leads to GM Magnus Carlsen.
  Even low rated players may find that they have 'defeated' Magnus in this way.
- Not necessarily shortest path. Therefore, might not find your TRUE Magnus number.
  For now, I have used some indirect workarounds to avoid overwhelming chess.com's public API.
- Work in progress. Dead ends may occur, despite best efforts to backtrack / avoid loops.
- Requires a modern browser.
